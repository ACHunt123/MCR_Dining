# MCR Dining 

This project calculated the nametags and seating plans for Caius Superhalls.

---

## Overview

Provided the UPay guestlist in HTML form (just get a window up on a browser and hit 'save as') getnames.py scrapes the HTML.

With this functionality one can print out the names of the guests, and input them into a google form
see https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1lK0tqWx0HeufNiollskzoGhktPDS-Jhi2K1nGNKI9mY/edit#settings for an example.

Please **do not edit the example form** - copy it first.

The excel spreadsheet generated by this form can then be read into generate_seatingplan.py, where all the magic happens.


## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MCR_Dining.git
cd MCR_Dining


to compile the cython, see the build_requirements.txt in the cyth folder and run the build command.
